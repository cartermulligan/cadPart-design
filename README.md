# cadPart-design
created a cad design based around a google images autodesk fusion sketch I found online. I will link the video that accompanies the picture, as the drawing I used
to create my autodesk design was actually a thumbnail for someone else's video. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dgp0yM6gMo0 <-- the video that uses the thumbnail I used to create the fusion design
(NOTE: I did not watch the tutorial to create this so my timeline and process to create the same part may not be the same as the one in the video.
I say may not because I did not watch the video and there's always a 1 billion to 1 chance that the process I used is the exact process the video uploader used.)
